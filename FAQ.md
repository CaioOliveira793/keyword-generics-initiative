## What is the goal of this initiative?

See the [Charter](./CHARTER.md).

## Who is working on it!

See the [Charter](./CHARTER.md).

## Does this overlap with the contexts-capabilities initiative?

The [contexts-capabilities
initiative](https://nikomatsakis.github.io/context-capabilities-initiative/index.html)
is another initiative working on extending Rust's type system. Those extensions
are orthogonal to the extensions proposed by this initiative. Though if both
extensions make it into the language, we expect people will want to use them
together.
